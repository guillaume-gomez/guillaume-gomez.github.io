I began writing my first lines in C at 15 and have learned a handful of programming languages since - be it in engineering class, for jobs, or just as a hobby. Having a passion for development and computing in general, I try to expand my IT knowledge writing small apps, video games and other oddities listed below. I spend most of my time AFK doing sports and am rarely seen without headphones."
